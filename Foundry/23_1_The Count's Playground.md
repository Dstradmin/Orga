## The Count's Playground 

If you've been in Ghent, chances are you've visited the "gravensteen", great building that hosts and awesome collection of old artifacts, iron suits and of course everyone's favorite: the  collection or torture tools. 

In a while the renovation of the castle starts, removing some previous 'additions' to restore the true nature of the building. 

We'd like to challenge you to use different techniques / technology stacks. Let's keep thing not to closely defined at the moment.

### Use augmented / virtual reality

- to show what it's going to look like when done
- reality to give an idea on how it used to look.
- make a virtual guide that teaches you things related to the exhibition?
- to create a game for kids and have them discover the castle

### Videotracking

- In the 'new' castle there will be camera monitoring. 
- Draw the path people are taking trough the exhibition.
- Some area's are securely protected by big velvet ropes, can you alert when people cross it.
- Can you alert us when a visitor disappears? Not in the pit of course. But if someone stays out of camera sight for a while he/she must be in one of the normally not accessible parts. We'd like to know.

### Interactive Projections

- Videomapping: of course this has to be more complex than 2 beamers and a mpeg loop. Maybe trow some video input in there, spice it with some Kinect 3D scanning. Challenge your visual creativity *and* your coding skills, when using both brain hemispheres you'll have twice the fun.

**Concluding:** everyone  likes Game Of Thrones, and this is the closest you'll get in our fine city. So put on your thinking cap, grab your laptop and join us on this quest.

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we lilke the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ‚ù§ Free Software, check our Github. We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use free code and give back to the community.
