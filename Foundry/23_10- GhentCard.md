## Ghent Card

What's up with all these cards? Got my library card, uitpas, and now people want to create another Ghent card. Then we have the E-id, and some other projects, like [itsme](https://www.itsme.be/). 

My wallet is so big I have to carry a purse, however my fragile sense of masculinity does not allow me. Poor me.

## Solution: 

Find a way to combine these cards in an app somehow. 

Maybe we can set up a trusted party to relay the credentials? Maybe there's another way?

In this project you'll learn about setting up a secure system on a mobile client. You get to design and implement your security solution.

This needs to be solid ofcourse, one mistake and we need to go explain it to the newspapers.

**Concluding:** If you're int security, this project is for you. You'll learn a lot about the hardware technology, but also on external back-end systems.

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we like the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ‚ù§ Open Source, check our [Github](https://github.com/lab9k). We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use open source and give back to the community.
