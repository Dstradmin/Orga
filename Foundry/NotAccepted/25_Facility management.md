## Facility management 

Plenty of challenges to go around in this one. 

- Tinder for space: hwo can we match supply and demand for spaces. This can entail houses, offices, logistic spaces, meeting rooms, gyms and others. How can we make this convenient and easy?



- Checks of spaces (staat van bevindingen): find a way to make a 'staat van bevinding' for multiple types of rooms. There are multiple tools available for houses but these are aimed at houses. Develop an easy way to take before after pics and metadata.

- Visualization/dashboard for buildings. We are looking for way to make the management of buildings more accessible. Which rooms are used, cleanded, how much foot traffic is coming in/out. BIM is a solution but aimed at architects, we're looking for way to manage the daily upkeep.



- Space management and occupationlevels: At the moment we're creating 'bezettingsrapporten' manually, this is done by specialized firms. How can we generate these reports, and which are the parameters we need?



- Predictive maintenance: atm the technical maintenance to buildings is ad-hoc. In an ideal world we could collect data and predict when maintenance would be needed. This way we can avoid problems. Also related to predicting / planning of the cleaning tasks we could use some help.



- Smart access systems: what is a good way to manage access in buildings?





## Solution: 

- Really up to you. We are open for your input and ready to give feedback. Think of solutions for tomorrow which are achievable today.

**Concluding:** Lot's of stuff to do, and a challenge that will rely on your creativity. The problems might seem mondane but your solution  has to be al but. 

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we like the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ❤ Free Software, check our [Github](https://github.com/lab9k). We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use free code and give back to the community.
