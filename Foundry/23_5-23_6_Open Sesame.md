## Open Sesame 

Bob works in the museum, well not really, he works in the back of the museum. His job is to sit behind a desk and wait for delivery people to show up. Bob checks them (well *most* of the time) and gives them a badge. Delivery people use that badge to drop of the goods where they need to be dropped. 

Bob is an art lover, but has no time to work in the museum. Poor Bob. 

## Solution: 

**First part:** We need an access system, login/pass? Sms? Fingerprint/iris? Something that makes onboarding new users easy. Maybe they ring a bell and bob can identify them on his phone? Mabe if they log in, bob gets an alert with a picture?

**Second part:** how do we give them the card to open the doors? Do we build some kind of 'vendingmachine' or something  that rotates the cards internally and gives the right card to the user?  Maybe something like those machines from bpost where you can get your package delivered to 24/7

## Related Challenge

Related to the previous challenge, we need to keep a list of visitors, it's in a big ledger on the front desk. Apparently it's needed in case the building burns down, makes it easier to know who to look for while rummaging. 

Anyway, there must be a better way to do this. Feel free to think about a creative solution. Security is not the main part of this challenge, but ease of use is. 
- sign on once, and do fingerprint?
- sign on once, and do face regonition ?
- E-id? 
- State your name and dospeech recognition?

**Concluding:** Access controls and robotics will not go away soon, so kickstart your knowledge here. I'm curious, can you build something I can't hack? Also let's all save Bob from burn-out.

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we like the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ‚ù§ Free Software, check our [Github](https://github.com/lab9k). We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use free code and give improvements back to the community.
