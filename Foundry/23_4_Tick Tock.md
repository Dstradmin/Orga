## Tick Tock 

Office workers, like yours truly, live in a strange world, with old habits that don't seem to die. The punch clock is one of them. Punch in in the morning, twice over lunch, and then once more when you go home.

They made it digital a long while back, with rfid badges and all that. Fancy, but basically they took the old system with paper cards and replaced it with the same system, it's network connected now, *meh*.

The system is limited, because it only tells people are in or not. What if I work from home, at one of the flexworkspots of the city, or even in my precious [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/)? Even if we're in, since our office is pretty huge, people might not be able to find me right away.

This sucks. 

## Solution: 

Let's get a bunch of those rfid stickers, place those on different desks in the office, one in the flexwork spaces, and why not, one on your desk at home for when you work there.

Let's put one in the meeting rooms as well, so people who might want to find me know that I'm not available. 

Badging in or out won't be with the card they gave us, but swipe your phone over one of those tags and it will register your presence there. 

We'd prefer a cross platform Android/iPhone solution, but if this is not possible, I myself am an android user, and will probably write reports about you during this project. :-) 

### Extra challenges

For the brave:

- Link it to Unitime the time tracking software with a sketchy api.
- Log it in the Blockchain for perfect transparency and accountability.
- Do something with secure id's so one account is linked to one phone to prevent fraud.

**Concluding:** personally I don't know any software that does this, and it seems that it has commercial potential. Feel free to take this idea, execute it perfectly and start your very own company, just send me an invite to the ipo-launchparty.

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we like the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ‚ù§ Open Source, check our [Github](https://github.com/lab9k). We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use open source and give back to the community.
