## Parking in style

Underground parkings are a hassle. Suppose you're having a job interview in the city of Ghent, near the vrijdagsmarkt, 9 in the morning, sharp.
You need to go by car, there is no way to know if there will be a spot, the evening before. Much stress, so worry. 

Suppose you could reserve a parkingspot In the parking of the vrijdagsmarkt?

## Solution: 

Let's build two entries to the parking, one for the people which didn't reserve, so when full the barier stays down. The other with automated license plate recognition, for reserved places. It recognises your plate and let's you in.

Internally the ALPR system guides you to your spot, there's even an e-ink display on the wall that shows your licence plate, and the fact that you reserved it.

**Concluding:** Stressless parking in style in the middle of an historic center. Could it be too good to be true? Also lots of fun with image recognition, and IoT displays.
