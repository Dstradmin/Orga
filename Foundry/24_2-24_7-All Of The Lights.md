## All Of the Lights 

Traffic lights are an important way to keep traffic safe in the city. They are also used to prioritise some traffic over other, they divide the availble time and space at an intersection amongst different users. This also means people are waiting more than they'd like to. Also, sometimes the lights are broken or they don't work like they should. 

In Ghent we believe in the concept of smart citizens, we believe you can't have a smart city without smart and well-informed citizens. We like to share information and data via the open data platform. This enables people to think for themselves on ideas to improve the city. 

It is our goal to emprove the knowlegde on traffic lights amongst our inhabitants, this means we need to share the princilpes on which light work with the people and also to share how the software works. 

### Principles

Lights are everywhere, but some people don't get the basic princples. We get a lot of questions: 

* When do you install lights?
* Why don't the buttons work?
* Why am i waiting at night while there's no traffic?
* Why do the Dutch traffic lights work better?
* Why is green so short for pedestrians? Can I cross when the light just turned red?
* Can you control them remotely, like in Oceans 11?
* What's the point of the camera's mounted?
* What is a green wave?

## V-plans

"Verkeerslichten Plannen" are called v-plannen. This is the programming of the lights. For each light in the intersections is determined when it's green, orange or red. These are quite technical plans and are not easy to read.

The most simple plan is to have red in one direction while it's green in the other, and nothing influences this. It get's more complex when there are more lights (example: for when you're turning right, seperate bike lights...) and when there are factors that influence it, for example pushbuttons, sensors, trams and busses...)

## Solution: 

In this project, we want to publish all v-plans of Ghent. So inhabitants and road users can verify if they work like they should. 

* We want to have visual representations.
* Maybe a simulator?
* But also premade simulations, drone footage, action-cam... is possible

Basically the format is not that important, let's find a way to make the people in Ghent see how lights work in their neighborhood say they can make suggestions and open a dialogue with the city to make it better. Maybe we can even simulate the impact of their suggestions.

We've got specialists from "Agentschap Wegen en Verkeer" stand-by to give ou input on your project.

**Concluding:** Make the people and the city smarter, find out why the dutch lights are better. And probably discover the secret to changing the lights 'oceans 11"-style, so you'll never have to wait again. ;-) 

**General Stuff:** This challenge was set up by [Lab9K](https://lab9k.github.io/), we challenge young people to have fun with new technology. We live on the peak of the Gartner Hype Cycle, just because we like the view. We've set up camp in the old library, feel free to come over and code. 

We ‚ù§ Free Software, check our [Github](https://github.com/lab9k). We'd like to encourage students to do the same, use free code and give improvements back to the community.
